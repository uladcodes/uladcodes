#Hey, I'm Ulad
Started coding in mid-April 2025.
Driven by curiosity and stubbornness.
Originally from Belarus - now based in New York.
I'm here to decode this world and eventually build my own. 

#My Philosophy
    I think like an architect: I love building things - but I need to know how 
every part fits before I raise the walls. That's why I start small, go deep, 
and plan for skyscrapers. 

#What I'm working on:
    * Real Gourmand = a multi-level Telegram bot for a restaurant with dynamic menus,
reservation system (coming soon), and user activity logging for furure AI-based UX optimization.
    * Colgate product scraper = finished a Selenium-based scraper
extracting product names, reviews, ratings, and ingredients.
    * Dating assistant chatbot = in progress: an AI bot that helps manage and respond to dating app messages.

Currently using = ["Python", "Pandas", "Selenium", "BS4", "Telebot", "Git", "VS Code", more is coming as I grow._

#Goals
- Build useful, multi-layered tools for real people.
- Join a forward-thinking tech team where I can grow & contribute.
- Master full-stack development & explore the intersection of logic and meaning.
- Think like an architect - build small with full awareness, plan big like it's a skyscraper.

Always open to connect - let's build something that matters.
